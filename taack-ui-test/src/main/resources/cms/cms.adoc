.Markdown code

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

----

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

=== List

You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

==== Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
----

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
1. First item

++++
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>
++++

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item

  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item
    <ol>
      <li>Indented item</li>
      <li>Indented item</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>
++++

==== Unordered Lists

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item
----

Gives:

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item
    <ul>
      <li>Indented item</li>
      <li>Indented item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>
++++

==== Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.
----

==== Adding Elements in Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

TIP: If things don't appear the way you expect, double check that you've indented the elements in the list four spaces or one tab.

===== Paragraphs

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
----

The rendered output looks like this:

- This is the first list item.
- Here’s the second list item. +
+
I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.
- And here’s the third list item.

===== Blockquotes

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
----

The rendered output looks like this:

- This is the first list item.
- Here’s the second list item. +
+
> A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

- And here’s the third list item.

===== Images

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

2. Marvel at its beauty.

=== Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (\***), dashes (---) on a line by themselves.


.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----

=== Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Something]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://google.com)).

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
My favorite search engine is [Something Go](https://google.com).
----

NOTE: To link to an element on the same page, see linking to heading IDs. To create a link that opens in a new tab or window, see the section on link targets.

=== URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>

=== Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.

.Markdown code
[source,markdown]
----
![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")
----

==== Linking Images

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.
